Time complexity using Big O

**Bubble Sort**
Best Time Complexity: best case O(n) When the array is already sorted.
Average Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Worst Time Complexity: O(n^2)

**Merge Sort**
O(n Log n):

The time complexity of MergeSort is O(n*Log n) in all the 3 cases
(worst, average and best).
As the mergesort always divides the array into two halves

**Quick Sort**
Best Case	O(n logn)
When the pivot element is the middle element or near to the middle element

Average Case	O(n logn
It occurs when the array elements are in jumbled order that is not properly ascending and not properly descending

Worst Case	O(n^2)
worst case occurs when the pivot element is either greatest or smallest element. 

**Insertion Sort**
Average and Worst: O(n^2)
Best: O(n)
this is the case when the list is already in the correct order

**Selection Sort**
Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average case.
Does not work well on large datasets.
